    "Answers": "In the case of a bank under liquidation the depositor has to approach the Liquidator of the bank for claim and the Liquidator would settle the claim as per the following procedure\n\nScenario 1: Claim on deposits covered by DICGC - If the deposits of a customer/depositor were covered by DICGC insurance at the time of transfer to the DEA Fund then the Liquidator can claim an amount equivalent to what could have been claimed from DICGC (i.e. currently up to ₹5 lakh including accrued interest if applicable in same right and capacity1) and then make payment to the depositor. If the above deposit amount is more than the insurance cover of DICGC then the Liquidator shall claim the amount in excess of DICGC insurance cover (i.e. over and above the ₹5 lakh) only on reimbursement basis. (i.e. the Liquidator will pay such amount to the depositor subject to meeting all the applicable requirements and thereafter submit a claim to DEA Fund for reimbursement)\n\nIllustration 1: A customer/depositor had a deposit claim of ₹4 lakh in a bank (including accrued interest) which is now under liquidation. The deposit was insured by DICGC at the time when the said unclaimed deposit was transferred to the DEA Fund. Now if he/she claims the same during the liquidation process the following steps shall be followed:\n\nThe customer/depositor/ legal heir submits a claim for his/her deposit to the Liquidator.\n\nLiquidator raises an equivalent claim of ₹4 lakh from DEA Fund along with necessary supporting documents.\n\nDEA Fund will pay an amount equal to the insured deposit to the Liquidator. (In this case i.e. ₹4 lakh since DICGC insurance cover is available up to ₹5 lakh).\n\nThe Liquidator after receiving the amount from the DEA Fund will pay to the customer/depositor i.e. ₹4 lakh.\n\nIllustration 2: A customer/depositor had a deposit claim of ₹6 lakh in a bank (including accrued interest) which is now under liquidation. The deposit was insured by DICGC at the time when the unclaimed deposit of his/her was transferred to the DEA Fund. Now if he/she claims the same during the liquidation process the following steps shall be followed:\n\nThe customer/depositor/legal heir submits a claim for his/her deposit to the Liquidator.\n\nLiquidator raises an equivalent claim of ₹6 lakh from DEA Fund along with necessary supporting documents.\n\nDEA Fund will pay only an amount equal to the insured deposit to the Liquidator. (In this case i.e. ₹5 lakh since DICGC insurance cover is available up to ₹5 lakh).\n\nFor the remaining amount (i.e. ₹1 lakh) the Liquidator shall make the payment to depositor subject to meeting all the applicable requirements and then claim for the same from DEA Fund by way of reimbursement.\n\nScenario 2: Claim on deposits not covered by DICGC: In respect of deposits not covered by DICGC2 at the time of transfer to DEA Fund the payment to the Liquidator by DEA Fund shall be made only on reimbursement basis (i.e. the Liquidator can only seek as a reimbursement after settling the amount to the customer/ depositor) as mentioned in Illustration 2(iv) above."
