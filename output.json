    "Answer": "The Daily Settlement Price is the closing price of the 10-year Notional Coupon-bearing GoI security futures contract on the trading day. (Closing price = Weighted Average price of the futures for last half an hour). In the absence of last half an hour trading, the theoretical price would be considered as the daily settlement price (DSP) and is determined in the following manner:\n Step 1: The DSP is the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the trades in the last 30 minute of trading, provided there are at least 5 trades for a minimum aggregate notional value of Rs. 10 crore. Failing which, trades during the last 60 minutes are used for the calculation of VWAP, subject to at least 5 trades for Rs.10 crore. Failing which trades during the last 120 minutes are used for the calculation of VWAP, subject to at least 5 trades for Rs.10 crore.\n Step 2: If the DSP cannot be calculated as above, a theoretical price is used. This theoretical price is the minimum of the theoretical futures prices of all the securities in the delivery basket chosen by the Exchange. The theoretical futures price of each security is the weighted average cash price of outright trades of that security during the day on the NDS Order Matching platform, adjusted for cost of carry, subject to at least 5 trades for Rs.10 crore. If there are not enough trades as required above or there is a material market event during the trading hours, the theoretical futures price of each security is the FIMMDA / PDAI / Bloomberg revaluation price(s) (published on the FIMMDA website on a daily basis: URL <a href=\"http://www.fimmda.org/default.asp?access=na),\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fimmda.org/default.asp?access=na),</a> adjusted for cost of carry. The cost of carry is computed for the period upto the last business day of the delivery month.\n If, however, the near quarter contract is liquid (5 trades for Rs. 10 crore during the last 30 minutes, 60 minutes or 120 minutes, as the case may be), the VWAP of the near quarter contract is adjusted for cost of carry to arrive at the theoretical price for subsequent quarterly contracts. Further, if near quarter contract is illiquid while the next quarter contract is liquid, then the VWAP of the nearest liquid quarter contract is used to derive the prices of the illiquid previous as well as the subsequent quarter contracts.\n The cost of carry for the above purpose includes the financing cost @ 91-day treasury bill rate and the coupon of the particular security."
